// ga_align_good-evil(int nActType, int nAlignmentShiftRule)
/*
    This changes the creature's alignment on the good & evil axis
        nActType     - On a scale from +3 (Saintly) to -3 (Fiendish), 
				      how much the act affects alignment
					  
		nAlignmentShiftRule -
				0 = no special rules - shift normally
				1 = good act shifts align toward good up to limit of 50 (neutral).
					evil act shifts align toward evil down to limit of 50 (neutral).
				2 = shift toward neutral in whatever direction necessary (good or evil).				

	============				
	Examples:
		ga_alignment_good-evil(2,2)  [or ga_alignment_good-evil(-2,2)]
			shift alignment by +3 for those with alignment less than 50 (to a max of 50); 
			shift alignment by -3 for those with alignment greater than 50 (to a min of 50)
		
		ga_alignment_good-evil(-2,1)
			shift alignment by 0 for those with alignment <= than 50;
			shift alignment by -3 for those with alignment greater that 50 (to a min of 50)
